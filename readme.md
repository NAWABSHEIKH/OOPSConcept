# Java OOP Inheritance Example

This project demonstrates Java OOP principles like:
- Abstraction (via abstract class `Vehicle`)
- Inheritance (via `Car` and `Bike` extending Vehicle)
- Polymorphism (via method overriding and dynamic dispatch)

## Run

`Main.java` prints details of vehicles using overridden methods.
